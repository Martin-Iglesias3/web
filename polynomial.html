        <h1>My Favorite Polynomial</h1>
        <p> I decided to choose the polynomial y=8x^9-11x^6+4x-10 because it offered some of my favorite numbers. Numbers like 10 in this polynomial I have a deep love for as some of my favorite soccer players have this number. Messi being one of these key players, ever since I was little I have loved watching Messi play. He is my idol and that will never change.
