<h1>Reason 1</h1>
<p>Firstly, soccer is the most popular sport meaning everybody in the world plays. This is a great advantage because no matter where you travel, you will be able to play soccer.</p>
<h1>Reason 2</h1>
<p>Secondly, soccer is a tactical sport. There is obviously the physical components of the game having to do with physicality, speed, agility and much more. On the other hand there is the very planned out way to see the game, this is where coaches step in and really change the games for players in their advantage.</p>
<h1>Reason 3</h1>
<p>Thirdly, you do not need to be extremly athletic to play soccer. You can be a pro player by just relying on your creativity and skill with the ball without needing to the fastest on the field. For example take a look at Messi, he is regarded as one of the gretest of all time and he is short and skinny.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I think these three reasons show clearly why soccer should be attributed as the best sport ever.</p>
